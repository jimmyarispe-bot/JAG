-- 332_interest_form_v7_gtid_2026_09_11.sql
--
-- Version 7: the Georgia Special Needs student identifier is called a GTID.
--
-- "Student ID" was my wording, not Georgia's. A parent holding an award letter
-- is looking for the label printed on it, and a form that invents its own name
-- for a field makes them guess whether the two are the same thing.
--
-- The question KEY changes too — `ga_special_needs_student_id` becomes
-- `ga_gtid` — because the key is what every answer is filed under in
-- `admissions_interest_answers`, and a key that says something different from
-- the label is a trap for whoever reads the answers in a year. This is only
-- safe because v6 has been live for minutes and no Georgia family has answered
-- it yet; once answers exist under a key, renaming it orphans them and the
-- right move is a new question instead.
--
-- Version 6 is archived, not deleted. Safe to re-run.
