-- 362_interest_form_v21_no_mailing_address_2026_09_14.sql
--
-- Version 21: the inquiry form stops asking a family for their postal address.
--
-- Jimmy, having clicked through the live form as a parent would:
-- "this is where it should end" — at Preferred contact method.
--
-- WHAT GOES. The whole Mailing Address section and its six questions:
-- street, line 2, city, state, postal code, country. The form now ends on the
-- Parent / Guardian Contact section, as asked.
--
-- WHY IT IS SAFE. Each of those six keys appears exactly twice in the whole
-- definition — once in the section's questionKeys, once as its own question. No
-- visibleWhen anywhere depends on them, so removing them cannot silently hide or
-- reveal anything else. And nothing in src/ reads any of them: they have been
-- collected from every family who ever filled this in and never once used.
--
-- Six required fields, asked of every parent, for nothing. That is the part
-- worth noticing — not that they are being removed now, but that they were being
-- asked at all, and a family who abandoned the form at "Street Address" was lost
-- for a question we had no use for.
--
-- ANSWERS ALREADY GIVEN ARE NOT TOUCHED. Interest answers are stored against the
-- version that was published when they were submitted. Version 20 is archived,
-- not deleted, so an address a family gave last week still means what it meant
-- and can still be read.
--
-- The section ordering closes over the gap: campus sections shift from 5..12 to
-- 4..11 so the form has no hole in the middle.
--
-- Safe to re-run.
