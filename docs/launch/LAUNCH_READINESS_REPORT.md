# AcademyOS Version 1.0 Enterprise — Launch Readiness Report

> Static reference copy. The authoritative report is regenerated on each full certification run and stored in the Certification Center (`launch_readiness_report` doc key). View at `/dashboard/certification/launch`.

**Build status:** `npm run build` passes  
**Migrations:** 172 (through `172_b1_security_remediation.sql`; authority: `supabase/migrations/`)  
**Readiness threshold:** 85%  

> **Phase H (2026-07-17):** Formal GA decision is **NO-GO** (54/100). See [`docs/launch/phase-h/`](./phase-h/). This static launch report is superseded for go/no-go by the Phase H package.

## Phase 1 — Platform Health Report

### Critical

- **Live OAuth connectors not implemented** — 40+ catalog entries; sync returns 0 records until credentials configured. Prioritize QuickBooks, Google, Microsoft.
- **Credential vault uses hash refs** — SHA-256 refs only; production needs KMS or Supabase Vault.

### High

- **API rate limiting partial** — Scholarship API rate-limited; extend to high-volume routes.
- **QuickBooks OAuth pending** — File import works; live QBO OAuth not wired.
- **Queue cron configured** — `vercel.json` every 6h; set `CRON_SECRET` in production.

### Medium

- **9 automation action stubs** — Registry placeholders; mark or implement.
- **Demo generator relational seed** — Org provisioned; run before sales demos.
- **No certification runs yet** — Run full certification on Launch Readiness dashboard (first deploy only).

### Low

- **Scholarship API hardened** — Auth, rate limit, applicationId required.
- **Public API doc routes** — Intentional for developer portal.
- **Navigation placeholder subtitles** — UX polish item.

### Performance

- **Mission Control index** — Migration 128 partial index on unresolved items.

### Security

- Rate limiting extension (see High).

### Accessibility

- **Accessibility certification engine active** — Maintain ≥85% on launch dashboard.
