 * this server generated. What was missing until now is the record saying whose
 * they are.
 *
 * `application_documents.lead_id` comes from migration 326, which also rewrote
 * the staff read policy to resolve a school through the lead when there is no
 * application. Without that policy change a row inserted here would be
 * invisible to every member of staff — an upload that succeeded, reported
 * success, and was seen by nobody.
 *
 * The cast is narrow and deliberate: 326 is hand-run, so `lead_id` is absent
 * from the generated database types and `application_id` still reads as
 * non-nullable there. Naming only this insert keeps every other query in this
 * file type-checked.
 *
 * A failure here is logged, not thrown. The family's inquiry is already saved
 * and telling them it failed would be untrue; a document nobody can see is a
 * problem for staff to chase, not a reason to lose the lead.
