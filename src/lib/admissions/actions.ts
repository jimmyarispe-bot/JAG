/**
 * Switch automated parent follow-up on, or off, for one family.
 *
 * THE DECISION THIS REPRESENTS. Leads already in JAG when the public inquiry
 * URLs went live on 10 September 2026 carry `automation_started_at = null` —
 * automation does not touch them. That is what let the forms go on the websites
 * without also chasing 289 families, 113 of whom had been parked at
 * `information_sent` since 2 February. Someone decides, per family, when it is
 * right to start.
 *
 * IT RESUMES, IT DOES NOT RESTART. The reminder engine derives which wait
 * applies from the lead's CURRENT stage, so a family sitting at
 * `shadow_day_scheduled` is chased about their shadow day, not welcomed as a
 * new inquiry. Most families a human starts are already halfway through the
 * process; that is the normal case, not the exception.
 *
 * Stopping clears the timestamp. Any timer already open stays open — closing it
 * is a separate, deliberate act, because silently discarding a live reminder is
 * how a family falls out of the process without anyone noticing.

/**
 * Enter an appointment stage the only honest way: book the thing first.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * There were two doors into tour_scheduled, interview_scheduled and
 * shadow_day_scheduled. scheduleTour and scheduleInterview did it properly —
 * insert the appointment, move the stage, notify the family. The pipeline
 * board's dropdown called updateLeadStage, which moves the stage and nothing
 * else: no tour row, no interview row, no email, no date anywhere. The family
 * appeared on screen with a shadow day scheduled and the only thing that had
 * actually happened was that a word changed.
 *
 * The board is the door on the screen, so it is the door people used. Twenty-
 * eight families, twenty-three of them at The Academy Virtual, and the only
 * reason anybody knows is that migration 361 went looking on purpose.
 *
 * This is one door for both boards. It cannot be called without a date.
 *
 * ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER
 *
 * Appointment first, then the stage. The database trigger from migration 361
 * fires on the stage change and reads the appointment to date its reminder, so
 * a stage that moved first would find nothing and create the loud "no
 * appointment is on record" task instead of the reminder. scheduleTour has
 * always had this order; it is not a new invention, it is the existing correct
 * one being made reachable.
 *
 * IF THE TRANSITION FAILS, THE APPOINTMENT IS REMOVED
 *
 * Otherwise a refused transition leaves a tour in the calendar for a family
 * whose stage never moved — a different lie in the opposite direction. The
 * delete is best-effort and its failure is reported, never swallowed.
