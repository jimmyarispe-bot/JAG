/**
 * Which permission opens each module in the sidebar.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES. The Modules list rendered every entry to every signed-in
 * person, with no permission check anywhere. A School Leader whose whole remit
 * is admissions saw Scholarships, Finance and Workforce sitting in her sidebar.
 * Clicking one bounced her off the layout guard, so she could not read the
 * numbers — but she could see that the money exists, who it belongs to as a
 * heading, and that the JAG has a Finance module she is being kept out of.
 *
 * "Never see anything about money" means the word does not appear on her screen,
 * not that the page refuses her after she clicks it. A guard that only fires on
 * arrival is a lock on a door with the contents listed on the outside.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS. Each module names the permissions that reveal it; holding any
 * one is enough. A module absent from this map is visible to everyone, which is
 * the right default for Calendar and Documents and the wrong default for money —
 * so the money modules are all named here explicitly, and the test alongside
 * this file fails if a new one is added without an entry.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. Row-level security is, and the layout
 * guards behind it. This decides what a person is shown. Both matter and they
 * are not the same job: hiding without guarding is theatre, guarding without
 * hiding is what we had.
