/**
 * Everything the plan builder needs about one child, gathered in one read.
 *
 * The screen this feeds replaces a person reading a price list and typing a
 * schedule into Word. That practice produced, in one folder: Hailey Rosser's
 * $2,000, Abigail McHoney's $3,325 against the family, Aaliyah Clinkscales'
 * $1,000, Penny Shropshire's $750, Alexander Pobuda's missing $1,000 discount,
 * and sixteen Florida schedules that do not add up.
 *
 * Six separate reads rather than nested selects. Each can be refused by RLS,
 * and a refusal returns no rows — which on this screen would look like "this
 * school sells nothing" or "this child has no scholarship". Both are answers
 * that would produce a wrong invoice, so each failure names itself.
